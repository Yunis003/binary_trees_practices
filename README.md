# C Binary Trees Practice

This repository contains my practice code for implementing and understanding binary trees in C. It covers various operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and balancing of binary trees. This is part of my journey to mastering data structures in C.

## Contents

- **Binary Tree Basics:** Understanding binary trees, their properties, and basic structure.
- **Insertion and Deletion:** Implementations of inserting and deleting nodes in binary trees.
- **Traversal Techniques:** Programs demonstrating different tree traversal methods:
  - **In-order Traversal**
  - **Pre-order Traversal**
  - **Post-order Traversal**
  - **Level-order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)**
- **Search Operations:** Implementing searching for a node in a binary tree.
- **Balancing Trees:** Techniques for balancing binary trees (e.g., AVL Trees, if implemented).
- **Tree Height and Depth:** Programs to calculate the height and depth of the tree.
- **Other Operations:** Programs implementing additional tree operations like finding the maximum, minimum, and successor nodes in a binary tree.

## Learning Progress

- **Completed:** Basic binary tree structure, insertion, deletion, and traversal methods.
- **Ongoing:** Advanced tree operations and balancing techniques like AVL and Red-Black trees.
